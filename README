The following software was written by Peter Combs (peter.combs@berkeley.edu),
and is released under the CRAPL v0 beta license.

This package contains a number of utility functions and full-fledged software
that I wrote to do two-color, super-resolution colocalization.  Full details
will be provided in a paper tentatively scheduled to be ready for submission in
Winter/Spring 2011.  Critical steps assume that you have access to
WHTrackHighRes, a FIONA program written (I believe) by Bruce Cohen.  Contact
Ahmet Yildiz (yildiz@berkeley.edu) for access to this.  Alternatively, you can
write your own---output is assumed to be a tab-separated list of positions in
nanometers, with two header lines and the following column order: x, y, sx, sy,
N, where N is your best attempt at guessing the number of photons

Vague instructions on use is available on the Yildiz Lab wiki at
