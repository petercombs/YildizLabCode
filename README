The following software was written by Peter Combs (peter.combs@berkeley.edu),
and is released under the CRAPL v0 beta license.

This package contains a number of utility functions and full-fledged software
that I wrote to do two-color, super-resolution colocalization.  Full details
will be provided in a paper tentatively scheduled to be ready for submission in
Winter/Spring 2011.

Vague instructions on use is available on the Yildiz Lab wiki at
