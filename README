I. Introduction
===============================================================================

This package contains a number of utility functions and full-fledged software
that I wrote to do two-color, super-resolution colocalization.  Full details
will be provided in a paper tentatively scheduled to be ready for submission in
Winter/Spring 2011.  


Vague instructions on use is available on the Yildiz Lab wiki at
http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~yildiz/wiki/index.php?title=Peter%27s_Lab_Methods

===============================================================================
II. Dependencies
===============================================================================

This code requires:
* Python (v2.6 or better --- certain functions use 2.6s exception catching syntax)
* SciPy (Tested with 0.8.0b1)
* Matplotlib (Tested with 0.99.3)
o pyfits (The important bit happens to be included, and is Copyright (C) 2005
	Association of Universities for Research in Austronomy (AURA) and covered under
	a separate license, available at
	www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyraf/LICENSE)

The Enthought Python Distribution is especially nice for getting everything you need, 
and is free for academic use.

Critical steps assume that you have access to WHTrackHighRes, a FIONA program
written (I believe) by Bruce Cohen.  Contact Ahmet Yildiz (yildiz@berkeley.edu)
for access to this.  Alternatively, you can write your own---output is assumed
to be a tab-separated list of positions in nanometers, with two header lines
and the following column order: x, y, sx, sy, N, where N is your best attempt
at guessing the number of photons

III. License
===============================================================================

The included software was written by Peter Combs (peter.combs@berkeley.edu),
